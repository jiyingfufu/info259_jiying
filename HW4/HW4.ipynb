        "# Homework 4: Large Language Models & Prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "### Due Date: March 8th, 2024 (11:59pm)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Total Points: 100 points\n",
        "- *Warning*: Start this assignment early as it is dependent on the OpenAI API!\n",
        "- **Overview**: In this assignment, we will examine some of the latest language models you may be familiar with like GPT-3. We'll cover:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Zero-shot prompting\n",
        "  - Prompt engineering\n",
        "  - Few-shot prompting\n",
        "  - Prompting instruction-tuned models\n",
        "  - Chain-of-Thought Reasoning prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OpenAI Account Setup**: You will need an OpenAI account and API key, you can [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch) (click on `API`) and learn [how to make an API key here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key). The OpenAI API is paid, however,  this homework will stay well under the free $5 credit given to each account. Be careful not to exhaust your free OpenAI credits while testing, you can check [on this page here](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage). To avoid exhausting your credits quickly, avoid running cells over and over again after you've completed an exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grading**: To complete the homework assignment, you should implement anything marked with `#TODO`\n",
        "  - **NOTE #1**: For this assignment you will be creating your own unit tests for the prompts you generate. For each 'Code' section below you are required to write **3 unit tests** per prompt and submit the prompt, unit test, and output (more details in Submissions section) in the report.\n",
        "  - **NOTE #2**: A boilerplate unit test function is provided below in the setup section, feel free to modify or come up with your own as long as you include the **expected** answer and the **response** from the OpenAI API in the cell output and report.\n",
        "  - **NOTE #3**: Points will be deducted if you go over the word limit for questions with a word limit.\n",
        "  - **NOTE #4**: Have fun with this homework! It's meant to be more exploratory and for you to gain exposure to current LLM trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Deliverables:** This assignment has several deliverables:\n",
        "  - Code (this notebook) *(Manually Graded)*\n",
        "    - Section 1: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6\n",
